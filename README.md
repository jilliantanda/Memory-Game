<Predictable Pepe>

# Description
Predictable Pepe is a play on the traditional card flip memory game. The game is a test of memory to remember the placement of cards after flipping one pair at a time. If a pair matches it stays flipped up, if it does not match, you will flip over the pair and try to remember the placement to create pairs with your next turns. 

# How to play

    #Setup of card board:
    -You will first select the card pack you'd like to use and then hit "begin"
    -Upon starting, 8 pairs of cards will be faced down.
    -You will have 20 attempts to find all the pairs on the game board. 
    -If you do not complete the game in 20 attempts, you will lose. 

    #How to play:
    -First click one card to flip it over. Next, select a second card.
    -If both cards match, they will remain face up. 
    -If they do not match, they will turn faced down again.    
    -Each time you flip a card upwards, it is important to attempt to remember it's position in the event it is not a pair.
    -In 20 attempts or less, continue turning over cards until the entire board is revealed with its pairs!
